Task2:
1:	1 block size 512-byte = 2MB
	4MB / 2MB = 2, requires 2 blocks
	16MB / 2MB = 8, requires 8 blocks
	512MB / 2MB = 256, requires 256 blocks
	2gb / 2MB = 1024, requires 1024 blocks
2:
It is not possible to utilize the entire 2MB tfs volume.
Given that there is a maximum of 20 files, which each have a max size of 127 blocks, we can only use 3175 blocks for files.
This results in 3+25+3175 = 3203 blocks, or 1.55MB, leaving 0.45MB wasted.

3:
If we dont want to waste any space, the ideal number of blocks are 3203.


4:
Given that the last word of a file header block is a pointer to a single indirect block,
the first block can support a file size of 512/4-1-1 = 126 blocks, the pointer then gives us a single indirect block,
resulting in the total size of 126+128 = 254 blocks, which is the equivalent to 130kb.

5:
Following the same pattern as before we get 125+128, for the first block and the single indirect block.
However the double indirect block increases the space with 128*128, as the last pointer points to a block off 128 pointers,
that points to a block of 128.
Resulting in 125+128+128*128 = 16637 blocks, equivalent to 8.12 MB
