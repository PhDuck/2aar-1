It looks like your implementation is on the right track. Next time, please
include a report even if your implementation is not complete. The report should
describe the ideas behind your implementation and any difficulties you have
experienced. Without it, its very hard for me to give you the feedback you need.


In common.c you should use process_join to wait for the initial program to
complete.

For your resubmission, please complete your implementation and write a
(preferably non-trivial) test case. Come to the exercise sessions if you're
having problems or have additional questions.
